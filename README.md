  ## Description
  JavaScript30 Project #10 - Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes
  <br><br>

  These code exercises use the following technologies: JavaScript. HTML. 
  <br><br>
  Given a task list with checkboxes, write JS code so you can hold down shift and check a range of boxes between two points. 
  <br><br>
  A good thought exercise. I was originally thinking it could be useful to define 'inBetween' mathmatically. This solution loops through every item and flips the switch from false to true when it hits the first checked and flips back when it hits the last check. 
  I was also interested to see this code again, as I don't remember using it much in my past projects:  
  document.querySelectorAll('.inbox [type="checkbox"]'); //Grabbing by type within square brackets.
